🚀 Excited to share insights from "Modern Software Engineering: Doing What Works to Build Better Software Faster" by Dave Farley! 📚

🔍 Key Highlight: Engineering: The practical application of science. Software engineers need to become experts at learning.

What is Software Engineering? It's the application of an empirical, scientific approach to finding efficient, economic solutions to practical problems. We must become experts at learning and managing complexity.

To become experts at "learning," we must apply:

- Iteration
- Feedback
- Incrementalism
- Experimentation
- Empiricism

To excel at "managing complexity," we need to focus on:

- Modularity
- Cohesion
- Separation of concerns
- Abstraction
- Loose coupling

Practical tools to drive an effective strategy include:

- Testability
- Deployability
- Speed
- Controlling variables
- Continuous delivery

Let's embrace these principles to build better software, faster! 💻
