# From Developer to Tech Lead

This are some notes from a MasterClass that I recently participate. In this meeting the speaker share some key aspect to be considered when a Senior Developer is promoted (or he/she intend to build a path to a engineering management role) to a management role.

## The key aspect to be considered

1. Undestand the new role
Learn to manage the "time" and the "task" for the new role. When this change is ongoing, you get a new title under you hood: "Lead of a technology team", this implied: "get the best performance of the team, oriented to the company/startup main goals".
With all this considerations and implications, manage you time become critical for success. A recommendation to planning the time is the following:

Dev  => 20% (only support development, mentoring, peer review, architecture review, high level support)
Product => 30% (product vision, roadmap, strategy, system architecture)
Ledership => 50% (most of the time need to be focus on leadership taks: one-to-one, career plan, onboarding, conflict resolution)


3. Adapt yout agenda to the new role
4. Get a proper onboarding on the new role
5. The first days considerations
