# Introduction

1. Engineering  - The practical application of science. Software engineer need to become experts at learning.
2. What is software Engineering? Software engineering is the application of an empirical, scientific approach to finding efficient, economic solutions to practical problems. We must become experts at learning and experts at managing complexity.
3. To become experts at "<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">learning</mark>" must apply:
	1. Iteration
	2. Feedback
	3. Incrementalism
	4. Experimentation
	5. Empiricism
4. To become experts at "<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">managing complexity</mark>" we need to following:
	1. Modularity
	2. cohesion
	3. separation of concerns
	4. abstraction
	5. loose coupling
5. The following are practical tools to drive an effective strategy:
	1. Testability
	2. Deployability
	3. Speed
	4. Controlling variables
	5. Continuos delivery
