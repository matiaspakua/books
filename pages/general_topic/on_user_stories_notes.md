# Introduction

## What is a User Story?

User stories were created to be "placeholders for a conversation." They allow us to defer detailed analysis until we're confident that the behaviour they describe actually needs to be developed.

User stories are a core practice in Agile methodologies, used to capture and describe features from the perspective of the end user. They provide a concise and clear way to understand what the user needs and why it's important, promoting collaboration and focus within development teams.

## key uses of user stories

* **Capturing user requirements:** User stories help to gather and document the needs of users in a way that is easy to understand and remember. This can be done through workshops, interviews, or user observations.
* **Prioritizing development work:** User stories can be used to prioritize development work based on the value they deliver to users. This helps to ensure that the team is working on the most important features first.
* **Estimating effort:** User stories can be used to estimate the amount of effort required to develop a feature. This helps to ensure that the team is realistic about what can be achieved in a given sprint.
* **Improving communication:** User stories can be used to improve communication between developers, product owners, and stakeholders. This is because they provide a shared understanding of what is being built and why.
* **Tracking progress:** User stories can be used to track the progress of development work. This helps to ensure that the team is on track to deliver the features that have been committed to.

## Characteristics of good user stories (INVEST)

* **Independent:** Each user story should be independent of other stories, so that it can be developed and delivered in isolation.
* **Negotiable:** User stories are not set in stone, and they can be negotiated between the product owner and the development team.
* **Estimable:** Each user story should be small enough that it can be estimated in terms of effort.
* **Valuable:** Each user story should deliver value to the end user.
* **Testable:** Each user story should be testable, so that you can know when it is complete.

## Examples of user stories

* **As a customer, I want to be able to search for products by name so that I can easily find what I'm looking for.**
* **As a website administrator, I want to be able to add new products to the website so that I can keep my inventory up-to-date.**
* **As a mobile app user, I want to be able to track my order status so that I know when my package will arrive.**

## User story slicing

User stories can sometimes be too large and complex to be developed in a single sprint. In this case, they can be sliced into smaller, more manageable stories. Slicing should be done vertically, meaning that each slice should include all of the layers of functionality needed to deliver a complete piece of value to the user.

**Here are some benefits of slicing user stories:**

* **Reduces risk:** By delivering smaller pieces of functionality more frequently, you can reduce the risk of delivering a product that users don't want or need.
* **Improves feedback:** By getting feedback on smaller pieces of functionality early and often, you can make sure that you are on the right track.
* **Increases engagement:** By delivering working features more frequently, you can keep stakeholders and users engaged in the development process.
