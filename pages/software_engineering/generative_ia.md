# Generative IA

## Introduction

**Concept**: Generative AI is a technology that can create new content, like images, text, or music, based on existing data.
**Impact**: Generative AI is revolutionizing how we work by automating repetitive tasks and allowing us to focus on more creative and strategic aspects. Here are some specific examples:
1. Easier content creation (text, music, images)
2. Faster access to information
3. Design assistance
4. Automation of repetitive tasks

## Differents types of generative IA

**Generative AI**: A specific type of AI that focuses on creating new content (text, images, music) as its primary function.

**Discriminative AI**: A broader category of AI that analyzes and categorizes existing data.

**Subcategories of AI**: The text mentions various subcategories like reactive AI (self-driving cars), limited memory AI (weather forecasting), Theory of mind AI (customer service chatbots), and others.

**Key Distinction**: Generative AI is specifically designed to create new content, while other AI subcategories might generate content as a secondary function.

## Understanding how Generative AI works

**Building Blocks of AI**: Similar to how we can identify objects based on past experiences, AI is trained on massive amounts of data to perform tasks.
**Generative AI vs Traditional AI**: Generative AI is a specific type of AI designed to create entirely new content, whereas traditional AI might generate content as a byproduct of its function.
**Generative AI Models**: These are the "engines" that power generative AI, built by specialists and funded by companies and universities. Examples include models from OpenAI, NVIDIA, Google, etc.
**Accessibility of Generative AI**: There are different levels of access depending on technical expertise:
**Business Leaders**: Partner with companies that have generative AI models or use open-source models for their projects.
**Creative Users**: Use pre-built generative AI models from repositories like GitHub and then combine them with AI notebooks (like Google Colab) to run the model.
**General Users**: Access generative AI through online services or apps like DALL-E, Midjourney, etc.
