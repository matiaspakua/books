## Introduction

This is a very complete, hand-on, medium level specialization based on cloud computing. Goes from the basics to some advanced and very helpful examples. The examples show you the 3 main cloud vendors platform: AWS, Azure and GCP.

## Highlights

**Courses list**:

- 01: Cloud Computing Foundations
- 02: Cloud Virtualization, Containers and APIs
- 03: Cloud Data Engineering
- 04: Cloud Machine Learning Engineering and MLOps


## 01: Cloud Computing Foundations

**The concept of Technical discussion**: use tools or capabilities in the same place where the project lives to communicate, for exmaple, in a Git Repo like github, using markdown file helps to detail a step-by-step process, with code snipped, diagrams, images, and so forth. AKA: **Technical notes**.

**Tools fot tech notes**: Gist, Code Snippets.

**Critical Thinkins**: key points:
 - Intellectual Humility: realize that you are NOT Right.
 - Courage: fight for what you velive
 - Empathy: go inside the mind of other.
 - Autonomy: go independently with your own ideas.
 - Integrity: be fair, be right, be sincere.
 - Perseverance: dont give up
 - Confidence in reason: faith in scientific facts,step-by-step
 - Fair-mindedness: accept criticism

**Effective Technical Triple Threat**
DonÂ´t be focus only in one think, but in multiple capabilities (aspects)

**Effective Technical Teamwork**
1. Clear, elevating goal. Something that motivate.
2. Result-driven structure.
3. Competent team-members
4. Unified commitment (everyone on the same page)
5. Collaborative climate (share, colab, learn)
6. Standars of excellence (what is good?)
7. External support and recognition
8. Principled ledearship (the leader need character)

**Technical Project Management**
1. Build a Quaterly schedule (week-by-week), an high level estimation
2. Weekly demo
3. keep a clean ticket traking systema, with easy to see TASK. Need to be clear to see progress and status (KIS = keep it simple)

**Project Management Anti-Patterns**
- Hero Driven Development (the superman of the devs)
- Crisis Driven Development (everyday is a crisis)
- Hippo Driven Development (higehst Pay desition person)
- Heavy Scrum (the ligher the process, the better, dont need to apply evething allways)
- Faith in People vs Faith in Process

### Introduction to AWS Cloud Development
 - Concept of Makefile (recipe)
 - Test (functional, integration, load). Verify, validate and save time.
 - Linting (check syntax)
 - Python Virtual Environment (isolate)
 - Github Action (SaaS build server), based on YAML.

### Introduction to Continuous Integration
 - Saves time
 - Safety mechanism (ensure that your SW is in a known state)
