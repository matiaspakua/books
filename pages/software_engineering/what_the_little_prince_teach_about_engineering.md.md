# What The Little Prince teach about engineering

"The Little Prince" by Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry is a classic novella that imparts valuable life lessons and wisdom. While it's not directly related to being a great software engineer, there are some universal principles and themes from the book that can be applied to personal and professional growth, including a career in software engineering:

1. **Imagination and Creativity:** The Little Prince encourages readers to embrace their imagination and see the world with a childlike sense of wonder. In software engineering, creativity and thinking outside the box are essential for problem-solving and innovation.
    
2. **Curiosity:** The Little Prince's curiosity drives him to ask questions and seek answers. Software engineers often need to be curious and inquisitive to understand complex systems and technologies.
    
3. **Attention to Detail:** The story emphasizes the importance of paying attention to small details. In software development, meticulous attention to detail is crucial for writing bug-free code and ensuring the quality of software.
    
4. **Seeing with the Heart:** The book teaches that what is essential is invisible to the eye. In software engineering, understanding user needs and designing user-friendly interfaces requires empathy and the ability to see beyond the surface.
    
5. **Exploration and Adventure:** The Little Prince's journey is one of exploration and adventure. Similarly, software engineers often embark on journeys of learning, trying new technologies, and exploring new solutions.
    
6. **Connections and Relationships:** The book underscores the value of meaningful connections and relationships. In the tech industry, teamwork, collaboration, and effective communication are vital for success.
    
7. **Simplicity:** The Little Prince appreciates the beauty of simplicity. In software engineering, simplicity in code and system design can lead to more maintainable and efficient solutions.
