# 18. Waterfall. The misunderstood concept in software engineering

## The wrong meaning

"Managing the Development of Large Software Systems" is a paper published in 1970 by Winston W. Royce, which outlines a traditional sequential software development process that is sometimes referred to as the "Waterfall" model. The paper describes a linear approach to software development, where each phase of the development process (requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance) is completed before the next phase can begin.

Royce presents this model as a response to the increasing complexity of software projects and the need for a structured, disciplined approach to software development. However, he acknowledges the limitations of this approach, particularly when it comes to dealing with changing requirements or unexpected issues.

Overall, the paper is an important historical document in the field of software engineering, as it helped to establish the Waterfall model as a widely accepted approach to software development. However, it has also been criticized for its inflexibility and its failure to account for the 
iterative and collaborative nature of modern software development.

## The True meaning

The paper "Managing the Development of Large Software Systems" by Winston Royce is often cited as the origin of the Waterfall model, but it actually critiques the Waterfall model as being too rigid and not suitable for most software projects.

In the paper, Royce argues that a more iterative and incremental approach is needed for large software projects, which would involve feedback loops and continual reassessment and modification of requirements and design. This approach is more similar to modern agile methodologies, which emphasize adaptability and collaboration.

So, in summary, the paper critiques the Waterfall model and advocates for a more iterative and incremental approach, which aligns with modern agile methodologies.
