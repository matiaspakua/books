## Highlights

**The concept of Technical discussion**: use tools or capabilities in the same place where the project lives to communicate, for exmaple, in a Git Repo like github, using markdown file helps to detail a step-by-step process, with code snipped, diagrams, images, and so forth. AKA: **Technical notes**.
