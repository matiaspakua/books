## 01: Cloud Computing Foundations

**The concept of Technical discussion**: use tools or capabilities in the same place where the project lives to communicate, for exmaple, in a Git Repo like github, using markdown file helps to detail a step-by-step process, with code snipped, diagrams, images, and so forth. AKA: **Technical notes**.

**Tools fot tech notes**: Gist, Code Snippets.

**Critical Thinkins**: key points:
 - Intellectual Humility: realize that you are NOT Right.
 - Courage: fight for what you velive
 - Empathy: go inside the mind of other.
 - Autonomy: go independently with your own ideas.
 - Integrity: be fair, be right, be sincere.
 - Perseverance: dont give up
 - Confidence in reason: faith in scientific facts,step-by-step
