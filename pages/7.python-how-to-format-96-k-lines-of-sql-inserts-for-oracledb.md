# 7. Python. How to format 96 k lines of SQL inserts for OracleDB

## Introduction
This is an example of the flexibility and easy user of python, where we solve a simple problem with a simple script in less than 5 minutes.


## The script
```python
# open both files
with open('swift-list.sql','r') as firstfile, open('swift-list-batch.sql','a') as secondfile:

    lineNumber = 1;
    insert_all = "INSERT ALL\n"
    select_batch = "SELECT 1 FROM dual;\n"

    # read content from first file
    for line in firstfile:
        # append content to second file
        if(lineNumber == 1):
            secondfile.write(insert_all)
        else:
            secondfile.write(line)

        lineNumber = lineNumber + 1;
        
        if(lineNumber % 1000 == 0):
            secondfile.write(select_batch)
            secondfile.write(insert_all)
```
