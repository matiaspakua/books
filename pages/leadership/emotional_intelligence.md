# Emotional Intelligence

## Introduction

Emotional intelligence, or EQ, is the ability to be aware of your emotions and triggers, manage your emotional responses positively, understand what's going on around you, and use that information to build strong relationships.

- **Benefits of EQ**: Enhancing your EQ can improve personal performance, support wellbeing, build strong networks, foster meaningful relationships, reduce stress or anxiety, better manage responses to challenges, and help in achieving professional goals.

- **Changeability of EQ**: Unlike general intelligence or personality traits, levels of emotional intelligence can change over time, providing an opportunity to develop EQ to achieve desired results.

- **Four Quadrants of EQ**: The four quadrants of emotional intelligence are self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management.

## Managing your Minset

- **Information Processing**: Your brain is constantly processing a multitude of information from your surroundings and your body, even when you're not consciously aware of it.
- **Cognitive Shortcuts**: To avoid feeling overwhelmed, your brain uses cognitive shortcuts to focus on important information and make quick decisions.
- **Emotional Triggers**: Certain events or situations can trigger negative emotional responses, leading to unhelpful interpretations of the situation and potentially detrimental behavioral responses.
- **Self-Reflection**: It's beneficial to pause, reflect, and identify recurring emotional responses or thought patterns that may be hindering your progress or well-being.
