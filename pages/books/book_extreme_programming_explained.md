# Introduction

"Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change" is a book written by Kent Beck that describes the principles and practices of Extreme Programming (XP), a software development methodology. Here is a summary of the key concepts presented in the book:

1. Continuous Integration: Don't release anything until it passes all the test. XP emphasises the importance of integrating code into the main branch of the codebase as frequently as possible. This helps to catch problems early and reduce the risk of integration issues.

2. Test-Driven Development: XP promotes writing automated tests before writing code. This helps to ensure that code meets requirements and reduces the risk of bugs.

3. Refactoring: XP encourages code refactoring, which is the process of improving the design of code without changing its behaviour. This helps to keep code clean, maintainable, and scalable.

4. Pair Programming: XP involves two developers working together on a single codebase. This helps to increase collaboration, reduce bugs, and improve code quality.

5. User Stories: XP uses user stories to capture the requirements of a system. User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature or requirement, and they help to prioritise work and ensure that the code is aligned with customer needs.

6. Continuous Feedback: XP involves seeking feedback from stakeholders and incorporating that feedback into the development process. This helps to ensure that the code meets the needs of customers and stakeholders.

7. Planning Game: XP involves regular planning sessions to prioritise work and ensure that the team is aligned on what work needs to be done.

8. Slack: XP recognises that developers need time to learn, experiment, and think about problems. The slack time is built into the schedule to allow for this learning and experimentation.

9. Sustainable Pace (no killer schedules): XP emphasises the importance of working at a sustainable pace, rather than burning out developers. This helps to ensure that the team can maintain its velocity and deliver quality code over the long term.

10. Don't put in anything that's not in the spec (no matter how temped you are to put in functionality "for the future").

11. KIS: keep it simple. Always.

## 01 What is XP?

1. Extreme Programming is about social change. It is about beign open about what we are capable of doing and then doing it and, it is about writing great code that is really good for business. Do you best and then deal with the consecuences. THAT EXTREME!!!!
2. It is reliad on oral communication, test and source code to communicate system structure and intent.
3. The more "humanely" I treated myself and others, the more productive we all became.
4. Technique also matters. We are technical people in a technical field.
5. Book recommendation: Colin Turnbull in The Mountain people and the Forest People.
6. You can do your best work even when there are constraints.
7. You can't control others expentaction.
8. How XP address the risks in the development process:
   1. Schedule slips: short release cycles, a few months at most.
   2. Project canceled.
   3. Keeps the system in deployable condition. Problems are not allowed to accumulate.
   4. Keep defect rate low.
   5. Avoid business misunderstood.
   6. Embrace business changes.
   7. Avoid "false" feature rich.
   8. Avoid staff turnover (mantains good teams together).

## 02 Learning to Drive

1. What is driving? is about constantly paying attention, making a little correction this way, a little correction that way. This is the paradigm for XP. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Stay aware. Adapt. Change</mark>. The problem is our inability to cope with change.
