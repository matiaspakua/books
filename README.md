**Who I Am**: [My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matiasmiguez/)

**What is this site for**: there are multiple reason for doing this:

1) practice english writing.
   
2) share knowledge and opinions.


3) log interesting topics.

Actually I have a lots of notes distributed in differents electronic devices, papers and others, so I need a method to organize all this information and with it, generate a knowledge base.

The content will record and enumerates without any particular order, just a list with the link to specific page where is the content.

**IMPORTANT**: All the notes are represent my personal research and opinion. I will keep references to original author and copyrights.
