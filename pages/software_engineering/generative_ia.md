**Impact**: Generative AI is revolutionizing how we work by automating repetitive tasks and allowing us to focus on more creative and strategic aspects. Here are some specific examples:
1. Easier content creation (text, music, images)
2. Faster access to information
3. Design assistance
4. Automation of repetitive tasks
