# 1. NoSQL. Concepts, uses, examples and highlights

## Introduction

NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL", and refers to a type of database that doesn't follow the traditional relational data model used by SQL databases. Instead, NoSQL offers a variety of data models, including document, column, graph, and key-value, that are better suited for a variety of applications and uses.

Some of the key features of NoSQL databases include:

 - Scalability: NoSQL is highly scalable, meaning it's easy to scale to handle massive amounts of data and a large number of users.
 - Flexibility: NoSQL offers greater flexibility in data structure, allowing users to model the data according to their specific needs.
 - Speed: NoSQL is faster than relational databases due to its ability to handle data in a distributed manner.
 - Availability: NoSQL is highly available, meaning data is always available, even when a server or node fails.
 - Query flexibility: NoSQL allows for great flexibility in querying data, meaning users can access the data in multiple ways, such as complex searches, data analysis, and geospatial queries.


Some of the most common uses of NoSQL include:

- Web and mobile applications: NoSQL is ideal for web and mobile applications due to its ability to handle a large volume of data and a high number of users.
- Big data and analytics: NoSQL is well suited for big data and analytics because it can handle massive amounts of data and support real-time processing.
- Real-time applications: NoSQL is ideal for real-time applications because it can handle a large number of simultaneous users and real-time data updates.
- Content management systems: NoSQL is used in content management systems to store and manage large amounts of structured and unstructured content.

## NoSQL Engines

Some of the most important NoSQL databases currently available:

 - MongoDB: A popular document-based NoSQL database that is widely used for web and mobile applications.
 - Cassandra: A highly scalable, column-based NoSQL database designed for high availability and fast data access.
 - Redis: An in-memory key-value store that supports advanced data structures such as hashes, lists, and sets, making it a popular choice for real-time applications.
 - Couchbase: A document-based NoSQL database that offers features such as full-text search, event-driven architecture, and flexible data modeling.
 - Neo4j: A graph database that is well suited for modeling complex relationships between data elements, making it a popular choice for recommendation engines and social networks.
 - Amazon DynamoDB: A managed NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services that is designed for high performance and scalability.
 - CouchDB: An open-source document-based NoSQL database that offers features such as versioning, bi-directional replication, and an easy-to-use API.

These are just a few examples of the many NoSQL databases available. The best NoSQL database for you will depend on your specific needs and requirements.

## MongoDB use-case

One common use case for MongoDB's scalability is for a web or mobile application with a growing user base.

Let's say you have a web application that is starting to get more popular, and you're finding that your current relational database is struggling to keep up with the growing volume of data and number of users. With MongoDB, you can scale horizontally by adding more servers to your database cluster.

Here's how this could work in practice:

 - Start with a single MongoDB server: When you first launch your application, you might start with a single MongoDB server to handle your data.
 - Add a second server: As your user base grows, you might start to see performance degradation on your single server. To handle the increased load, you can add a second MongoDB server to your cluster.
 - Use sharding to distribute data: To further scale the system, you can use MongoDB's sharding feature to distribute the data across the two servers. Sharding allows you to split a large collection of data into smaller chunks and distribute these chunks across multiple servers.
 - Add more servers as needed: As your user base continues to grow, you can keep adding more servers to the cluster to handle the increased load.

By adding more servers and using sharding, MongoDB allows you to scale horizontally and handle an unlimited amount of data and users. This makes it a great choice for web and mobile applications that need to scale to handle a growing user base.

## Sharding: a key feature to scalability

Sharding is a technique used to distribute a large volume of data across multiple servers in a database cluster. The goal of sharding is to improve performance, scalability, and availability of the database by spreading the data across multiple servers and allowing multiple operations to be performed in parallel.

In MongoDB, sharding is implemented by dividing the data into smaller chunks, known as shards, and distributing these shards across multiple servers in a sharded cluster. Each shard is a self-contained database, and each server in the cluster can contain one or more shards.

Here's a basic overview of how sharding works in MongoDB:

 - Enable sharding on the database: Before you can start sharding, you need to enable sharding on the database that you want to distribute.
 - Choose a shard key: The shard key is a field in the documents that determines how the data is partitioned across the shards. When you choose a shard key, you need to consider the distribution of the data and the queries that will be performed on the data.
 - Create a sharded collection: Once you have enabled sharding on the database and chosen a shard key, you can create a sharded collection by running the sh.shardCollection() method in the MongoDB shell.
 - Add shards to the cluster: After creating a sharded collection, you can add shards to the cluster by setting up additional MongoDB servers.
 - Monitor and optimize the cluster: Finally, you need to monitor the cluster to ensure that the data is distributed evenly across the shards and that the performance is optimal. If needed, you can optimize the cluster by moving shards from one server to another or by adding more shards to the cluster.

Sharding is a complex topic, and there are many factors to consider when implementing sharding in MongoDB, such as the size of the data, the distribution of the data, and the queries that will be performed on the data. However, by following these basic steps, you can get started with sharding in MongoDB and take advantage of the increased performance, scalability, and availability that it offers.

## Flexibility in MongoDB

One of the main benefits of MongoDB is its ability to provide flexibility in the data structure. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means that documents within a collection can have different structures. This allows for greater flexibility in the data model and eliminates the need for rigid, predefined schemas.

Here's an example to demonstrate this flexibility:

Let's say you have a collection of user information in a MongoDB database. You might start with documents that look like this:

```json
{
   "_id": ObjectId("5f45a9a9c2d57b86dc22e3e6"),
   "username": "johndoe",
   "email": "johndoe@example.com",
   "age": 32
}
```

As your application evolves, you might find that you need to add additional information to the user documents, such as the user's address:

```json
{
   "_id": ObjectId("5f45a9a9c2d57b86dc22e3e6"),
   "username": "johndoe",
   "email": "johndoe@example.com",
   "age": 32,
   "address": {
      "street": "123 Main St.",
      "city": "San Francisco",
      "state": "CA",
      "zip": "94102"
   }
}

```

With a traditional relational database, you would have to modify the schema of the entire table to add the new field. However, with MongoDB, you can add the new field to only the documents that require it, leaving the other documents unchanged.

This flexibility in the data structure allows you to evolve your data model as your application evolves, without having to make significant changes to your database schema. Additionally, it enables you to store semi-structured data, such as nested arrays or sub-documents, in a single document, rather than having to spread the data across multiple tables in a relational database.
