## Introduction

Excellent 3 days of the #H4CK3D 2022 event organized by Securetia and the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Palermo.

## Day 1 Highlights
  
 - 🔒 SSL is essential for encrypting web traffic and ensuring data security.
 - 🔑 Symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of public and private keys.
 - ⚠️ Symmetric encryption is vulnerable due to the need to transmit the encryption key.
 - 🚀 Asymmetric encryption eliminates the risk of key transmission by using a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
 - ⏳ Asymmetric encryption is slower than symmetric encryption.
 - 🌐 SSL plays a crucial role in secure web communication and protects sensitive information.
 - 📝 Understanding SSL and encryption methods is important for ensuring data privacy and security.
