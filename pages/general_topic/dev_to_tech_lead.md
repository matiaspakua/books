# From Developer to Tech Lead

This are some notes from a Masterclass that I recently participate. In this meeting the speaker share some key aspect to be considered when a Senior Developer is promoted (or he/she intend to build a path to a engineering management role) to a management role.

## The key aspect to be considered

### Aspect #1:  Understand the new role

Learn to manage the "time" and the "task" for the new role. When this change is ongoing, you get a new title under you hood: "Lead of a technology team", this implied: "get the best performance of the team, oriented to the company/startup main goals".

With all this considerations and implications, manage you time become critical for success. 

A recommendation to planning the time is the following:

 * Dev  => 20% (only support development, mentoring, peer review, architecture review, high level support)
 * Product => 30% (product vision, roadmap, strategy, system architecture)
 * Leadership => 50% (most of the time need to be focus on leadership task: one-to-one, career plan, on-boarding, conflict resolution)


### Aspect #2: Adapt your agenda to the new role

Adapt you older / current daily agenda involves a shift in your responsibilities and priorities. Here's what it means in more detail:

1. **Leadership and Mentoring:** In a higher role, you're expected to provide guidance and mentorship to your team members. This means allocating time for one-on-one meetings, code reviews, and addressing their concerns. A great reference for leadership is the book "Leaders Eat Last" by Simon Sinek.
    
2. **Project Management:** You'll be responsible for project planning, scheduling, and ensuring that the team meets its goals. "Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time" by Jeff Sutherland is an excellent resource on agile project management.
    
3. **Strategic Thinking:** Your agenda should include time for strategic thinking. This could involve setting long-term goals, technology selection, and aligning the team's work with the organization's objectives. "Good Strategy Bad Strategy" by Richard Rumelt is a must-read for strategic thinking.
    
4. **Communication:** Effective communication becomes a critical part of your role. You'll need to communicate with stakeholders, superiors, and your team. The book "Crucial Conversations" by Kerry Patterson provides valuable insights into effective communication.
    
5. **Time Management:** As you take on more responsibilities, efficient time management is crucial. You may want to read "Getting Things Done" by David Allen for practical techniques.
    
6. **Delegation:** You should allocate tasks to team members according to their strengths and provide them with the autonomy to complete those tasks. "Drive" by Daniel H. Pink is a great resource on motivation and delegation.
    
7. **Conflict Resolution:** Be prepared to handle conflicts within your team. "Crucial Conversations" and "Difficult Conversations" by Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen are excellent references for managing conflicts.
    
8. **Learning and Skill Development:** Continuous learning is key. Allocate time for staying up-to-date with industry trends and new technologies. For this, consider resources like online courses on platforms like Coursera and edX, or subscription services like Safari Books Online.
    
9. **Measurement and Feedback:** Implement metrics and feedback mechanisms to track the team's progress. "Measure What Matters" by John Doerr is a valuable resource on this topic.
    
10. **Cultural and Organizational Awareness:** Understand your organization's culture and values and ensure your team aligns with them. "The Culture Code" by Daniel Coyle is a helpful book in this context.

### Aspect #3: Get a proper on-boarding on the new role

Getting a proper onboarding in your new role as you transition to a higher position in the software engineering field is essential. It means having a structured and comprehensive process in place to help you seamlessly integrate into your new responsibilities. Here's what it entails:

1. **Introduction to the Company and Culture:** You should receive an in-depth introduction to the company's values, mission, and culture. Understanding the company's ethos is crucial for aligning your actions with its goals. This information might be provided in the form of documents, presentations, or meetings.
    
2. **Understanding the New Role:** You should receive clear documentation or training that outlines your new role's responsibilities, expectations, and key performance indicators. This could include role-specific job descriptions and objectives.
    
3. **Meetings with Key Stakeholders:** An onboarding process should include meetings with key stakeholders, such as your direct manager, peers, and subordinates if applicable. These meetings provide insights into the expectations and dynamics within your team and help establish working relationships.
    
4. **Technical Training:** If your new role involves technologies or tools you're not yet familiar with, the onboarding should include technical training or access to resources like online courses, documentation, or mentorship.
    
5. **Process and Workflow Training:** Understanding the company's processes, workflows, and project management methods is crucial. You should receive training or documentation on how things get done, including tools and methodologies like Agile, Scrum, or DevOps.
    
6. **Resource Access:** Ensure you have access to the necessary resources, including software, hardware, and access permissions to perform your role effectively.
    
7. **Organizational Chart:** Receive an updated organizational chart that shows the hierarchy of your department and the broader organization, as well as contact information for key individuals.
    
8. **Expectations Setting:** Your manager should clearly communicate their expectations regarding your performance, project delivery, and any key performance indicators or goals. It's also important to discuss the timeline for achieving these expectations.
    
9. **Feedback Mechanisms:** Know how and when performance evaluations will occur. Understand the company's feedback and review processes, including any peer reviews or 360-degree feedback.
    
10. **Mentorship and Guidance:** If possible, be assigned a mentor or buddy who can guide you through the initial phases of your new role. This individual can provide insights, answer questions, and offer support.
    
11. **Company Policies and Compliance:** Review and understand the company's policies and guidelines, especially those related to compliance, security, and ethical standards.
    
12. **Professional Development:** Be informed about opportunities for professional development, including training, workshops, conferences, or certifications.
    
13. **Probationary Period (trial mode):** If your new role includes a probationary period, understand its duration, objectives, and evaluation criteria.
    
14. **Documentation and Resources:** Access to a centralized repository of relevant documentation, best practices, and resources related to your role can be extremely valuable.

15. **Rollback**: It's a good practice to discuss the potential for a "rollback" to your previous position during your onboarding. This option should be explored under certain conditions, such as if the transition to the new role is not successful, or if it becomes clear that the role isn't the right fit. The terms and conditions for a rollback should be clearly defined during onboarding, including the time frame within which this option can be exercised and the criteria for making this decision. 

A well-structured onboarding process can significantly ease the transition into your new role and set the stage for your success. It's important to actively engage with the onboarding process, ask questions, seek clarification when needed, and provide feedback to help improve the process for future employees.
