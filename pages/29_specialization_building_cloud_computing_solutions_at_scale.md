- 01: Cloud Computing Foundations
- 02: Cloud Virtualization, Containers and APIs
- 03: Cloud Data Engineering
- 04: Cloud Machine Learning Engineering and MLOps


## 01: Cloud Computing Foundations

**The concept of Technical discussion**: use tools or capabilities in the same place where the project lives to communicate, for exmaple, in a Git Repo like github, using markdown file helps to detail a step-by-step process, with code snipped, diagrams, images, and so forth. AKA: **Technical notes**.

**Tools fot tech notes**: Gist, Code Snippets.

**Critical Thinkins**: key points:
 - Intellectual Humility: realize that you are NOT Right.
 - Courage: fight for what you velive
 - Empathy: go inside the mind of other.
 - Autonomy: go independently with your own ideas.
 - Integrity: be fair, be right, be sincere.
 - Perseverance: dont give up
 - Confidence in reason: faith in scientific facts,step-by-step
 - Fair-mindedness: accept criticism

**Effective Technical Triple Threat**
DonÂ´t be focus only in one think, but in multiple capabilities (aspects)

**Effective Technical Teamwork**
1. Clear, elevating goal. Something that motivate.
2. Result-driven structure.
3. Competent team-members
4. Unified commitment (everyone on the same page)
5. Collaborative climate (share, colab, learn)
6. Standars of excellence (what is good?)
7. External support and recognition
8. Principled ledearship (the leader need character)

**Technical Project Management**
1. Build a Quaterly schedule (week-by-week), an high level estimation
2. Weekly demo
3.
