# Gradle

## Introduction

Gradle is an open-source build automation tool used primarily for Java projects, but it can also be used for other languages such as C++, Python, and Swift. It uses a Groovy-based domain-specific language (DSL) to define the build configuration and dependencies, making it easy to manage and automate the build process. Gradle allows developers to define custom tasks, handle dependencies, and manage the overall build lifecycle of their projects. It is also highly extensible, with a vast ecosystem of plugins and extensions available to customize its functionality. Gradle has gained widespread popularity in the Java community due to its flexibility, performance, and ease of use.
